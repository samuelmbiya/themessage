[Gap in the audio]Heavenly Father, we thank Thee already because Thou hearest our--our desires when we make them known, and our heart, You know even the thoughts of our heart. Our brother is very sick, I may have never met him in my life, but Thou knowest him. I'm sending that handkerchief in the Name of the Lord Jesus; and I pray God, when it's laid upon his body, that the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise him up. Grant it Lord, spare him this night, I pray in Christ's name. Amen. [Gap in the audio]There has been a few things that's been bothering me; and that for some time. And I--I don't know any better place in my life to start from than Connersville, Indiana to do what I'm fixing to do see, that's right. It's a little... probably my last revival before going overseas. And they're making ready now, and I don't know just what the time. I'm a little startled. Brother Beeler here... [Gap in the audio]I--I didn't... I knowed the man had a great name, and I slipped in behind a Coke machine to pray for him. He heard me confess it the other night when he was setting here. And then I went back home, they called me again, said, "Come on in." So I went over there, and just knelt and while I was kneeling there our Lord Jesus stopped the hemorrhaging and never had it since, see. He was perfectly normal and well from then on. So he just follows the meetings, and a very fine brother.And while we were setting talking with Brother Beeler here. Been taking recordings here, an evangelist, a World War veteran, had a disaster, and hurt one of his hands and had to amputate it. And God... If you hear his story, if you're in evangelistic... wanting an evangelist, I would recommend Evangelist Beeler, as one of my bosom friends, and co-worker with me in the tabernacle at Jeffersonville. And he's here, he never told me to say that, but I just said it because I felt lead to say it, and a very loving brother. And while we were setting, having a meal together, I started to say something to Dr. Cauble, and I begin to talk to Brother Bosworth which was standing right before me; and he's in Africa, been there nearly a year, setting the meetings together. And then as I seen Brother Bosworth, he was coming this a way, to me. And I was talking to him, Brother Bosworth, and Brother Cauble and Brother Beeler looked around. And why was I talking to Brother Bosworth while talking to them? And here he was coming across the waters like that. I don't know what it means, only thing I can say that's what it was.There is something has happened somewhere recently. I was riding one evening going down the road, about five or six months ago. The house had been packed all day, and--and I said to the wife, "If you can wait just a little bit, let me... don't let anyone else come in till I can get just a little rest. And I'm just about to pull my--my hair." And I got out and went down the road, and we was riding along in the car and all at once I seen something, the windshield begin... I looked and it, something happened. And--and I seen Brother Bosworth coming walking to me, and he laid down and some doctors picked him up and put him on a bed, and he was crying and he was calling my name.And I--I heard my wife saying, "What's the matter?" Said, "You set so quiet for five minutes" and going around real steep cliffs on a old, rural road like that, and I didn't even know I was driving. So I stopped, and I said, "Honey, something's happened to Brother Bosworth, and let's pray. The Lord wants me to pray right now." And we started praying, and in just twenty-four hours, we checked the time, I was sitting in the house with a number of friends; and the phone rang and it was a cablegram from Durban, South Africa. That when he stepped off the train the prostate glands closed up and he was carried to a hospital, and he was calling for me to pray for him. And just exactly, the Angel of the Lord had beat that cablegram here twenty-four hours. That--that's how I begin to pray. And then immediately after that we give him a call, and he was done up and going again then. The Lord had done heard and answered prayer. Now isn't that wonderful? And God in heaven knows that to be true, and how that He's--He's been wonderful.When the Angel of the Lord... I have a lot of criticism. I--I hope you believe me to be an honest person. I--I try to be honest. I--I try...want to be a man of honor, and a man of honor will be truthful and honest. And I--I've tried hard to serve the Lord. And I... when I... what I'm going to say now is just... for just a few moments, if you want to catch it now, I want it to go in the magazines.And now to this audience here tonight, and a--a confession. In the beginning of my ministry... When a little baby born up in the hills of Kentucky, this light that you see on this picture here that we have tonight; and they've been selling at the meeting, just at... what it... We have to send, get them ourself, it's a copyright. That same Light come in that little cabin and stood over the bed, a little corn shuck bed, where I was born in a cabin in Kentucky, on April the sixth, 1909. And from a little bitty--little small lad of about, I suppose, two years old, was the first time I remember of That speaking to me. And He told me I would live near a city called New Albany, Indiana.Well, that's where I've lived. And I was... That was a hundred and eighty or ninety miles up in Kentucky, near Burkesville, Kentucky.]]></verse><verse label="2" type="custom"><![CDATA[2 Now, that's... All down through life That kept being remarkable. It'd show me things, tell me things was coming to pass. And I'm, to this night, I would like to ask any person in this world (and I'm willing to be exposed by any remark), that if any one time that you ever heard It say one thing but what was absolutely the truth, and that everything come to pass that He said so far, as far as I know, but this vision about Africa and India. And it will be. He tells things that will be, and things that has been, things that's on the--coming. I can't do it myself. He does it. And I've tried to be honest.And when the Angel of the Lord met me, I... First, the people told me, the ministers... My pastor and the head man of the church, the officials and so forth, told me it was the devil. Only the devil would do things like that. Well, of course, it scared me. For years and years, I shunned it.]]></verse><verse label="3" type="custom"><![CDATA[3 But one night, up here in Indiana, I was praying at an old fishing camp, where I used to go fishing. I'd go back in there many times to pray. And He had come to me. Under this Light, stood a Man, around six foot tall, hundred and--two hundred pounds, big arms, dark hair to His shoulders. And He was standing under that Light. And He told me I was borned in this world, to pray for sick people. Now, that's what He told me.And said, "And you're to go be--pray for people around the world, for kings and monarchs and so... How could I believe that with a grammar school education? And I said to Him, I said, "Sir, I dwell among my people which is poor, and I'm uneducated, therefore I could not do this." He said--I said, "They wouldn't believe me."And He said, "As the prophet Moses was given two signs, so shall it be given to you. Of two signs of a vindication of your ministry."And--and I said, "Me? Pray for kings?" He said that was what I was to do. All right.And so then, He said... I asked Him and He told me what to--what it would be. How I'd say... to pray for the people. And said for a Divine healing. And then said, "You'll know the very secrets of their heart."And I said, "That's what I was here praying about. They told me (my ministers and them) told me it was of the devil." And He told me it was of God and referred to these Scriptures that I refer to, of Jesus Christ how He'd know the thoughts of the people's--of the woman at the well and so forth.]]></verse><verse label="4" type="custom"><![CDATA[4 Well, I told Him I'd go. And that's been six years ago, yeah, nearly seven. In that time, I've visited three kings' palaces, which has called on me to pray for them. And doctors and great men, congressmen and everything has been healed throughout the entire world---statesmen and everything.I tell you what I've done, my Christian friend, as a confession. I say this without bitterness. I say this with the sincerity of my heart, before God who is my solemn Judge. I believe I've done wrong in one way. I believe I've depended too much upon that discerning spirit instead of praying for the people.Now, He never told me to go and tell everybody; just talk to them. He said, "Pray for the sick." That I was sent... And here's what He said, "If you'll be sincere when you pray and get the people to believe, nothing will stand before the prayer." Many of you has read that story, haven't you? How many has read my life story on that? I guess everybody in here, see.]]></verse><verse label="5" type="custom"><![CDATA[5 It's published in seventeen different languages around the world. And tonight, by God's grace, it's seven years ago, just a little local Baptist preacher here in Jeffersonville, tonight by God's grace and His help, I have contacted, direct or indirect, around ten million people, and has sent out many great campaigns across the world.Right in my own meetings, there's been nearly a half a million converts. And I don't know what it's produced out in others.And now, by that I'm very thankful. But here's what I think I've done. I think in bringing the people up... If I could show you in my office, just for the last year that I've kept, just of letters, who says, "Brother Branham, I love you as a Christian brother. But I've been to as many as fourteen and fifteen of your meetings, and I can never be able to get up there for you to pray for me." Well, then I get others.]]></verse><verse label="6" type="custom"><![CDATA[6 Here the other day, a man down in Arkansas gave me a real good ... a good friendly criticism. I appreciate that. Sometimes that helps me. It'll help anyone, a good criticism. He said, "Brother Branham, I've been to all the meetings, the divine healing meetings throughout the country." He said, "I think yours is tops." He said, "I appreciate you in every way. But," said, "I think God raised up Oral Roberts to take your place, because there's something wrong with you that you won't pray for the people." That cut; that hurt. God bless Brother Oral Roberts. He's my brother. If God chooses him to go out and...He said, "While you're praying for three people, Oral Roberts will pray for five hundred." Now, he does. He just brings them through. You've been to Oral's meetings. How many has ever been in Oral's meetings? Most of you. Oral is one of my converts, not to divine healing, because he believed it in the first place. But he come, set on my sidelines at Kansas City, having a little bitty tent meeting, with a dozen or two over in the other side of the city.And he come over there and he said, "Brother Branham..." That night back behind the curtains where we got our picture standing there. You seen it in the Voice Of Healing. He said, "Brother Branham, you think God would hear my prayer for heal the sick?"I said, "He will hear anybody's prayer that'll be sincere."He said, "Here I go, to pray for the sick."I said, "The Lord God bless you, my brother."]]></verse><verse label="7" type="custom"><![CDATA[7 Little Tommy Osborn, I think is the most settled man there is on the field anywhere. If anybody knows Tommy Osborn... I think there's not a man on the field or anywhere in the divine healing campaigns, that's any more settled. He don't make any kind of big shows or brags. He preaches the Gospel. He never lays his hands on a person. But he does most of his works over in foreign countries.And he goes over there and just explains divine healing so plain that the people just raise up, and accept Christ and get healed, and walk away. He doesn't make any wild claims. He only claims that he knows... When he come to me, we was sitting out on the porch. He'd seen that maniac out there. You read it in the book here. Little Tommy when he was converted, just a little old brother up there, had about a dozen in his mission.He was sitting there that night and seen that maniac run to the platform. And brother, you mustn't bluff when you come against anything like that. You must know what you're talking about. An insanity...]]></verse><verse label="8" type="custom"><![CDATA[8 And so, he seen what happened. He locked himself in a room for three days, nailed himself up and then come down to my place. And he said, "Brother Branham, my heart's stirred. Do you think God has give me a gift of divine healing?" I looked at him. He was a promising young man. And I said... Very nervous. He just... You know how he is. Little bitty fellow and... I said, "Brother Osborn, look. You don't understand what a gift of healing is, brother. A gift of healing is faith in healing." I said, "What you believe. If you believe it, of course, that's right. It's all by faith.""But" I said, "Brother Osborn, you're a promising little man. And I see that you're ... I believe you're a good level Scripture teacher." I said, "Let me ask you something. If you want to be a success in life, don't claim nothing you haven't got. It'll be showed anyhow after while that you're falsely," see. I said, "Just be honest before God and go on out." I said, "You know... You believe the Bible teaches divine healing?"He said, "Yes, Brother Branham."I said, "Teach that. God made you a preacher. And you go out and just preach the Word." I said, "You see the old oak tree?" (Which that was Brother Bosworth.) I said, "Get with him and stay with him about a year. Let him teach you all the angles." I said, "He's been preaching divine healing before I was born. He was preaching divine healing and holding meetings."And Brother Osborn stayed with him about a year and a half, and he is one of the most solid men on the fields.]]></verse><verse label="9" type="custom"><![CDATA[9 Now, here's what it's done, Christian friends. How many Holy Ghost people is here tonight born-again? Let's see your hands way up high now, Pentecostal people? All right. It's you I'm going to talk to. And I'm going to talk to you from the depths of my heart, which this is going in magazines now. In many magazines it'll go across the world (see), what I'm going to say.It's a pity that Christianity and Christian people can't settle down to real truth about things. It is, see.]]></verse><verse label="10" type="custom"><![CDATA[10 Now, I tell you what. I have tried to follow the leadings of the Holy Spirit. When I first started praying for the sick, I started out and the people---they all seek after wonders and signs. I'll say as Martin Luther, in his footnotes in one of his sermons. He said, "The people goes after gifts instead of the Giver." That's true, see. They go after signs instead of the Giver.Now, that's a whole lot among we people. I'm glad that if you'll let me call myself one of you tonight, among one of your group. That's what's the trouble. Not only in our Pentecostal groups, but out yonder in the fundamental ranks too, it's a carnal comparison, friends. I say this with love. But it's got to a place the people see something done, then everybody tries to impersonate that same thing. And when they do that, it's not the truth, brother. They bring things which is unscriptural.]]></verse><verse label="11" type="custom"><![CDATA[11 Here the other day, a man come in... A man drove all the way from California to my place with a little girl, about sixteen years old. And some fellow said, "I've got the Spirit like that too." Said, "I've got a spirit of discernment." Said, "Oh, that girl's got cancer." And like to scared the little thing to death. They drove from California. That child didn't have no more cancer than this little boy here is cross-eyed, see. Not a bit more.The child was all right. Hundreds of people coming into the meeting. And here someone wrote to my secretary the other day, Mrs. Cox. And said, "I have the spirit of the discernment too." He said, "Of course, I know, Brother Branham, but" said, "you have gall stone, you have this and you..." Why, the list of things that long. Said, "The reason, you're living up in a house that a stream of water runs under it." Friends, no wonder this world scorns and laughs at divine healing.]]></verse><verse label="12" type="custom"><![CDATA[12 Here the other day, I seen a person had an old man in a sheet. I went to what they call a healing service. They was jerking him up-and-down like that. And the old fellow had heart trouble. And a woman taking a stick, and run around beating like that, saying, "Get out devil. Shoo, shoo," like that---talking about divine healing.And I went to a healing ... a man very prominently known. Said, "I got healing in my right hand." Laid it on a person, said, "Feel that? Feel that?" And I called the man back behind his tent, and I said, "It's a lie." That's right. I said, "You can get by that. Sure, people will just believe just anything you tell them. But" I said, "in the sight of God you'll have to answer for that someday."]]></verse><verse label="13" type="custom"><![CDATA[13 And here the other night, standing right here... The man's listening to me, no doubt, now, a fine man. I don't know his name. I was talking to him yesterday. The man is probably listening to me right now. He stood there and was talking to me about people coming around.Said, "Here's what makes it on divine healing." He said, "I've watched about your offerings, Brother Branham," see. He said, "I've noticed you've never strained on offerings."I said, "No, sir. No indeedy."And he said... And many times, my managers has said, "Brother Branham, we ain't got enough money to make the expenses. We got to put some pressure on the meeting."I said, "No. You'll never put pressure on any meeting that I'm preaching in, for money. No, sir. I never come for that. I come to help people." That's exactly right. Sometimes it gets so low, we have to go and maybe borrow money somewhere to tie that over. And sometimes our meetings---maybe in the thousands---won't average over a half a cent apiece of the people. But we never let them beg for money. No, sir. That's against the rules.]]></verse><verse label="14" type="custom"><![CDATA[14 And this man was telling me, said, "I was in a campaign here not long ago," and he said, "you know what happened?" He said, "The man stood up." And he said, "After he took a offering, he'd go down and say, 'Who'll give me tens?' and 'Who'll give me fives?' and like that."Now, brother, God have mercy on me. If I ever have to get to do that, then I'll go back home, and lay on my stomach and drink branch water, and eat soda crackers, and half starve to death, and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ before I'll do something like that. God being my helper. That's right. That's right. Yes, sir. God is able.He told a couple of farmers, said, "Now, the Lord is going to send a storm through here and tear up your farms if you don't put in a couple of hundred dollars."Now, that's a lie. And that's just what gets people so down on divine healing and truth. But, brother, in the midst of all that---to you fundamental people that's sitting here---there is a real genuine God that heals the sick. And there's a real genuine... That's right.]]></verse><verse label="15" type="custom"><![CDATA[15 I went to a lady's meeting, here some time ago. I won't call names. But just to show you. The lady stood up and said, "The Lord tells me there's somebody in here got a kidney trouble." Oh, sure. There's probably a dozen or two sitting in here that's got kidney trouble. "The Lord says there's somebody in here that's backslid, and He is talking to them right now." Well, probably that's right. If the Gospel is being preached, it's talking to every backslider, see. That's true.That's psychology, friends. That's purely psychology. And that's all. And now, I'm honest with you, and I'm going to tell you something, see.]]></verse><verse label="16" type="custom"><![CDATA[16 I went to a meeting here recently, and a man very well known (and a Baptist brother was sitting with me), and he'd just got... And you wonder why I'm not in the Voice Of Healing. That's the reason. Everything going along like that. Why, brother...A certain person in there that said (they were sitting in the room praying), and said God the Father sent two angels down and picked him up and took him up in the presence of God. And said, "My son, I'm giving you the gift of divine healing."Now, that's wrong. There is no such a thing. There's "a" gift, but not "the" gift, see. And taken before God the Father, no man has seen God and look at Him in His face like that. That's right. And said it ... the Angels... And said, "He said, 'My son, I'm giving you the gift of divine healing. And I'm sending you back to the earth and giving you power to open the eyes of the blind, to unstop the ears of the deaf," and so forth like that. And people reading that, shouting. Brother.]]></verse><verse label="17" type="custom"><![CDATA[17 Now, this is kind of cutting it home tonight. But listen. This is what will do you... You might not like me now, but, brother, at the day of judgment you'll see I've told you the truth and been one man that's honest with you. That's right.Now, that's just as unscriptural as it can be. And when this Baptist brother come around, he said, "Brother Branham, I got your paper."I said, "Not my paper."He laid it down and said, "Look at this. What do you think of this?"I have nothing against the Voice of Healing. But the trouble with the Voice Of Healing... Here's why I got away from it: It glorifies the man instead of the Christ. Christ is what we want to get glory. This man's got a tent; they out-seats this one. And this one out-seats that one. Who are these men? Who are we? We're nothing but six foot of dust by the mercies of God. If we got what we deserve, we'd be in hell. That's exactly right.It's Jesus Christ we're trying to exalt and point to. Not whether you got a half-a-dozen or ten thousand. What difference does that make? If you're looking for numbers, why, the Catholic church has done got us so snowed under... And the world has done got us beat all together.It's not numbers. God doesn't dwell in multitudes. He dwells in sincere hearts. Christ: What do you think Christ's crowd would have compared with Caiaphas' would've called over the nation? His little crowd of three or four, five thousand at a time when they gathered together and the people with Christ's day. But Caiaphas could have called three or four million together. So there you are. No, not in crowds, friends. Don't get that on your mind.]]></verse><verse label="18" type="custom"><![CDATA[18 But this person said (this doctor of divinity) said, "Brother Branham, did God do that?"I said, "I'm going to beat you to it. Now, I can't say whether He did or didn't. I'm not the judge. But I'm going to say before you tell me: Let me see Him prove it," see. That's right. Let me see it proved, then I'll believe it, see.If God give the man power to open blinded eyes, it doesn't belong to God anymore. It belongs to the man. If you give me the money to buy a suit of clothes, said, "Here Brother Branham, here's money to buy you a suit." It's not yours anymore. It's mine.If I'm a healer, then I can heal. If God give me the power to open blinded eyes, then I can open them. That's my business then; it belongs to me. But God never give it to any man. He hasn't give it to me. And I don't believe there's any man living today that has it. And it ain't coming. Because that lays in Calvary, and it's already been done. Only thing any man can do is point you to what's already been done for you in Jesus Christ. That's right. He is the Jehovah-jireh. He is God's Provided Sacrifice. And everything that you have need of, lays in Him.]]></verse><verse label="19" type="custom"><![CDATA[19 Standing there the other night, a lady come up. This man said, "I smell a spirit of an infirmity." Now, the sense of smelling declaring a supernatural being, you know that's not right. And yet, five or six thousand people setting there. "I... 'Sniff, sniff [Brother Branham illustrates.]' I smell an infirmity. 'Sniff, sniff [Brother Branham illustrates.].' It's here somewhere." Now, you know... I'm not criticizing the man. I'm just only... I ask you first if you were Pentecostal people. I'm trying to get something to you that's the truth.]]></verse><verse label="20" type="custom"><![CDATA[20 And brother, now, I'm going to make a confession. I think I'm the cause of a big part of it. Now, that's right. And I ask God to forgive me. If I'd have kept my senses right and not listened to a bunch of managers to try to just bring everybody by and this, that, or the other. And went ahead and done what God told me to, I'd been better off tonight and so would the whole church. That's right. It's true.Now, that's the honest truth. Sure, that's a sign. Absolutely. I'll give anyone... You go down to my city; you take any of my books; you go anywhere you want to and see if one thing was ever predicted, anything... And if I was dying right here at this platform tonight, and my hands laying on the Bible right here before my Lord Jesus, He is the supernatural Light that you see. I have seen Him.I've seen Him right out there, standing, with my eyes wide open, looking at Him. He's come to me and told me things. And that gift of discernment to know things that was to come to pass and how He reveals it, it's without one blemish, the honest to goodness truth. Now, that's right. That's...]]></verse><verse label="21" type="custom"><![CDATA[21 And that wasn't done to... Moses, when he had taken his signs, he didn't go down and say, "Now, looky here. I'm healing my hand with leprosy. You see? And I'm taking this..." He did it once. And then said, "Come on. Follow me."But that's been wrong. Everybody has rallied to see the gift work. Everybody has rallied to see this work. And every person that they think... If God don't tell them just what's in their life and how it's going to outcome, they can't step out for faith. It's--it'll become such a thing, like the brass serpent was, one of these days. The prophet run in there and tore the thing up. That's the truth. Now, I'm preaching to myself. And what's that... If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. And I did wrong in doing that.]]></verse><verse label="22" type="custom"><![CDATA[22 When thousands of people has come to the meeting, I ought to have been bringing them across the platform praying for them, what God told me to do. Don't you think that's the truth? So, by God's grace and God's help, and if He will give me grace to do it, I'm intending by His help... Sure, them signs, that gift, it'll always accompany my life---it'll always be---as long as I'm here on earth. That'll be just the same. "Gifts and callings are without repentance. God will deal with me the way I use it. But it's without repentance. It'll always remain there. That's true.And if I'd have went ahead like I started at first... I just brought the people across the line, and I prayed for each one of them. And when something showed me that there was something wrong, or something I should tell a person, I stopped them and told them what to do. Then I went ahead and prayed for another one. I'd pray for a hundred, or maybe a hundred and fifty, two hundred a night, maybe more than that. And people just flocked in everywhere.]]></verse><verse label="23" type="custom"><![CDATA[23 But now, what's happened. There's just a few; I have to stop, and it's... And if I just let the vision come as it will, it doesn't bother me, what I'm going... It's a Divine gift that I take up my own parable of work that He told me, and--and go forward to meet the thing. Then you see, you're forcing yourself in to something. See what I mean?But now, there's--there's people... There's even people setting right here since I've been talking, I absolutely know, was setting right here and seen the Angel of the Lord stand over them in a vision, know what is wrong with them, standing right here in the platform, where I'm standing now. Now, that's the truth. See?But I--I just don't say nothing about it, and I just go ahead and pray for the sick. And I think that's what I'm going to do by God's help. That's right. Go right around and start praying for the sick. And God says anything to do, well, then I'll do it. See? And if He don't tell me, then I'll just go right ahead and pray for the sick and go on. It's up to you to believe it.]]></verse><verse label="24" type="custom"><![CDATA[24 And now, look. Through there... Everybody seen the meetings. When I first started, there was a lot of tinsel on it. When I first started, why, there was tens of thousands of people would swarm out everywhere. Then everybody begin to get... Three or four of these Pentecostal groups, one of them said, "Come, go with us. We're the larger group."The other one said, "No. We got the most spiritual people."I stood in the breach and said, "We are brethren." Not what this group was, what that group was. We are one in Christ Jesus; and quit the fussing about who's this and who's that, see. You're getting just as formal as the rest of the churches by it, you see. And of course, it will.

Stay in it and stay spiritual. And look at the next man across the street and recognize him as your brother. Yes, sir. That's right. No matter what church he belongs to.If he is a Methodist and got the Holy Ghost, shake his hand and say, "Hello, brother." Baptist, Presbyterian, or Roman Catholic, no matter what he is, if he belongs to the Church of God, Assemblies of God, Pentecostal United Church, or whatever they are. Everybody's brothers in Christ Jesus when we become borned again of the Spirit of God. That's right. And there's no difference in us. God set some in the church for certain things.

Will you pray for me and--and the success, that God will help me? And by my... Friends, if I got anything that I think is wrong, I'm going to confess it right here, not wait to get up yonder. I'm going to tell it right here. That's right.And I've been honest with you. And I'm trying to be honest. I--I want to be honest. And I--if I am honest with you, I'll be honest with God. And if I'm not honest with you, I can't be honest with God. That's right. 'Cause you're the purchase of His Blood.The way I treat you, that's my attitude towards God. I've often wondered what I would do if I had a little charger that had two drops of the literal Blood of Jesus that fell at Calvary. How I would embrace that and how close I would walk with it, that I didn't drop it or anything.Do you know in the sight of God, I've got a greater than that here before me tonight? I've got the purchase of His Blood. He loved you more than He loved His own life. He gave His life for you. So, how must I handle you? I must be honest and sincere. And I think maybe we'll just start...]]></verse><verse label="27" type="custom"><![CDATA[27 And you men and women here, just preach the Gospel. Don't claim nothing that you can't back up. For Satan's going to bring it to a showdown. That's exactly right. That's right.Like people trying to impersonate the Holy Spirit. Many of them going out and spoke with tongues and claimed to have the Holy Ghost and done everything there was to be done. That's right. They didn't have the Holy Spirit to start with. Right. But they was just trying to impersonate some ... act like somebody else.You be just what you are. And God help us to see the day when everybody will be what they are. Just exactly. Anything I despise, is a hypocrite. That's right. God hates the same thing. It'd be better for an infidel ... would have a better chance getting to heaven than the hypocrite.

Because I believe Him.And I believe Divine healing, and I know it's right. And that's why I'm here declaring it. If I didn't believe it, I certainly wouldn't be here trying to say something that I didn't believe in. I'd be here declaring just what I thought was right.If I could join up with the fundamental groups and say that the Church of Christ and the--many of the others that doesn't believe in Divine healing... And--and their way, if I could believe that was the truth, I'd be right with them tonight. It's exactly.But I do not believe that they're Scripturally right, so I believe that God's Word here proves Divine healing. I believe the Holy Spirit... The proof of the pudding is the eating thereof. Look what God is a doing. See? And I know it's the truth and that's the reason I'm with this group tonight. Is because that I believe they've got the real absolutely charm of God's love in their hearts. I believe it.I believe they need a lot of good sound teaching, but I believe they got the Holy Ghost. I believe that. That's the reason I'm with them. That's the reason they sponsor meetings, because they believe in the supernatural.

If you won't get a book now, and been thinking, "About Sunday night, I'll get it," get it tomorrow night. I thank you.I'm not a book salesman. I don't sell books, friends. If I didn't think that would help you, I wouldn't say one word about it and wouldn't even have it published or permitted to be published. And they're not my books. I buy them at forty percent off, and bring them here and sell them to you (that's exactly) for handling charges.That book belongs to Gordon Lindsay. The other one belongs to Julius Stadsklev.

And He went and took the Book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne. And loosed the seals thereof and opened the Book.And, O Lamb of God, come tonight. And as I turn back these pages, open the Word to us, Lord. Loose every seal, and may the Spirit of God move in this building tonight. Convince sinners of their wrong.

And he saw the condition of the Church in this day.Now, this prophecy, of course, like all other prophecy, has a compound meaning. A prophecy sometime has a natural meaning.

Now, of course, the natural meaning of that, even Dr. Scofield in his footnotes (I'm not a Scofieldite) but--but however, in his footnotes there, he gives that it meant when the Syrians come over and invaded.

That's the tame tree and the wild tree. And we were the wild tree which was grafted into the tame tree.And Jesus spoke of there in Matthew 24, "When you see the olive tree ... or, the fig tree, rather, putting forth buds, you know that spring's nigh."

He studied to be a Roman priest and got sour against the thing. And went back out into the world and become a perfect infidel. And was standing ...

And I--I didn't know too much about the Scripture. So, he... I don't yet tonight. But I know the Author of it; that's the main thing. So then, he said, "Well, how many senses is to the human body?" And he was a smart man.And I said, "Well, you know."And he said, "I want you to say."I said, "Five."He said, "Name them."I said, "See, taste, feel, smell and hear."Said, "All right.

And I thought, Lord, what can I do? In my heart I was praying. I begin to see something. You know, they say, "Give a cow enough rope, he'll hang himself." So, that's about right.

And I was riding out through the moonlight, and I come to where there was a big old burn-over. And there was a great big bunch of great big tall stately pines. And the moon was shining on them. It looked like a graveyard, a spooky-looking place.And there come a wind coming down. And the wind begin to hit them and they'd go, "Moooo," just a mournful sound.I stood and looked at it a little bit. And I thought of this Scripture right here. Yes, sir. Those trees puts me in a mind of some of these great big fine spired churches standing up here, but just as dead as a doornail. Even the palmerworm's eat all the bark off of them and everything else. The fiery trials has blazed all the Spirit away from it and there's nothing left but a big statue, just as dead as can be.And when the rushing mighty wind comes from heaven, the only thing they can do is groan, and carry on, and say "It ain't so" (That's right.), hardly knowing anything. That's right. They say, "Days of miracles is past." Just every time God sends a revival, and signs and wonders begin to come up, and fall around the people, and things like that, they say, "Oh, the days of miracles is past."]]></verse><verse label="49" type="custom"><![CDATA[49 What the palmerworm left, the caterpillar eaten.

Watch the same thing. You've took the route of the dead tree. What the palmerworm left, the caterpillar eaten. The Baptist took the shouting away from the Methodist.

Oh, my.But I happened to notice, down underneath there, was some undergrowth coming up, some little bushes about like that. They had life in them.

You say, "Well, wait till I can get ready." When God called Moses, he didn't have nothing in his hand but a stick.God said, "What is that in your hand?"He said, "A stick." Not very much.But said, "Take that.""How am I going down to whip that army.""Well, what you got in your hand?""A stick.""Take that and go down. Whatever is near you, pick it up and go on." And away went Moses down there, a one-man invasion to take over Egypt with a stick in his hand. God told him take what he had.]]></verse><verse label="56" type="custom"><![CDATA[56 I seen not long ago... I was having a meeting in a football stadium. And as I went in, I read a little sign. It always struck me. It said up there, "It's not the size of the dog in the fight, but it's the size of the fight in the dog." That's true. Amen.It's what you've got in you, what your make-up is. Yes, sir, brother. I admire a little old Airedale. He is not very high, but he is all dog. I like that. I like a man when he is born again, no matter how little, or how uneducated, or what he is. He's all man. He's all God. He's out for the thing he stands for. Amen. That's what I like. A people, no matter how little you are, how you're called holy-roller, a off-cast, whatever it is, stand.

And a bunch of Philistines got upon him. A thousand of them begin to run upon him. He didn't have nothing. Now, and all these Philistines standing there.What if he said, "Now, wait till I get out and learn how to spar. Wait till I learn how to do this. Wait till I learn some fencing, know how to duel and so forth. Maybe I can get me a sword and come back. Perhaps in just a little while, maybe I'd can whip some of these Philistines." Ha! Not that. The only thing laying close to him was the jawbone of a mule. And he picked that up, and the Spirit of God come on him, and he killed a whole group of Philistines.What we need today is get out and do something. There's emergency on. We ain't got time to hang around and fuss around with the things. Let's get going.]]></verse><verse label="58" type="custom"><![CDATA[58 I think of old Shamgar during the time of the judges over there in Israel. Why he was over there and every man done right in his own sight. And the Philistines would come up, and take all they had, and go back with it. Israel would raised their crops, put it in the barn. Philistines would walk right up...That's just like the devil. Rob you of everything. Some of you pastors get your little church built up, just about where you think it's right. And some old devil will come in there say, "Why, there is no such a thing as that old Holy Ghost religion. I don't even believe in no such a thing." Brother, what I mean to tell you, if you don't believe in getting angry then, let your righteous indignation rise up. That's right. Call black black and white white. That's true...]]></verse><verse label="59" type="custom"><![CDATA[59 I see old Shamgar standing out there. He had put in his... all these... He said... Not very much wrote about him in the Bible but what was wrote is enough. He was standing out there. Had his barns all fixed up and everything was just going fine. And he was standing there looking and thought, "Well, now maybe every year them Philistines has come. Maybe they won't come this year. And I see my family is all starving, and they look so poor and thin. But now..."And while he was standing there, he heard a noise. He raised open the window and looked coming down the road. Here come six hundred armed Philistines. There goes his crops. Spear and armor. The big old heavyish feet there with the armor on. "Tromp, tromp, tromp," trained man, warriors from birth, spears in their hands, swords hanging on their sides. Six hundred, "Coming up, Shamgar. You had a nice crop this year. We're glad you worked for us." Here they come up like that. That's the way the devil does: take away everything you got if he can. That's him.]]></verse><verse label="60" type="custom"><![CDATA[60 Shamgar looked at him and thought, "Oh, here it goes again." He stood there and he thought, "Well..." Looked down at his poor little old wife, her little sunk-in face, maybe, and his little children. Their little sleeves were ragged. Their clothes were gone. His poor wife was starved to death. "What will the winter be this time." There it is."Now, all the... year after year they've come. And here they are coming again. I'm just... We just about starved last year. Now, they'll take what I got now. What will I do? Just what gleanings I can get out of the field." He stood there; he thought, "Here. Here they come, closer and closer."

He begin to feel it coming up on him. He said, "Here, I'm a Jew. I'm circumcised. I've got a right, for this land belongs to us." And I tell you, he wasn't a warrior; he couldn't wait till he learned how to fight. He was a farmer, he wasn't a fighter. But he knowed that he had ... the promise of God was with him. And he was circumcised.And if every man here tonight would realize that the things that you got, divine health and everything else, God gave it to you at Calvary. Every born-again man is circumcised by the Holy Ghost. You have a right for every redemptive blessing. Let the devil rob you out of none of it.Shamgar didn't have no sword. He didn't know nothing about it if he had one. He didn't have a shield. But if he had a shield, he wouldn't know how to use it. But he reached up and got a ox goad. That's an old stick that's got a brass lump on the end of it; they beat the ox through the corral with it. And he jumped out of that window out there in the middle of that road against six hundred armed Philistines, and killed every one of them. Hallelujah!]]></verse><verse label="62" type="custom"><![CDATA[62 What was it? The Holy Spirit come on him. Hallelujah! There was a need; there was emergency. Something had to be done. He couldn't wait till he got an education, learn how to fight, and be a warrior, and train up. He had to take what was in his hand and go do something with it.And, brother, what's that close to you tonight? You've at least got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. This whole group here, you raised your hands. What's that? The greatest weapon you can put in your hands, with the Word of God behind it to back it up.

And many was going to follow him. And there he was setting on his chair, just riding down the street. And when they did, he stopped over there, he said, "I want all of my officers tomorrow, to meet me here. And I want the one honorable man to ride by my side in this great parade tomorrow."And all of the officers, they trimmed their plumes, and they polished their shields and everything. And they fixed their big tags on them and so forth. And they was passing by Caesar, each one with his big fine plume, walking straight and sturdy passing by. Caesar looked at them, and setting there...And after while, a little bitty old doughboy, one of those little footman came by. And he was all cut, and scratched, and scarred, and bruised. He passed by, and just bowed his head, and started to run off, he felt so embarrassed standing before the great emperor. And he started to run away.And directly the emperor said, "Wait a minute." Said, "Who are you?" Said, "Come here."He said, "Yes, my lord." He walked up to him and fell down like that. And he raised up.Said, "My, you're cut up awful." Said, "Where'd you get all them scars and things?"He said, "Out on the battlefield, fighting for my lord."He said, "You climb up here and set down. You're the one deserves it."

Yes, sir. Show some scars. You ain't had no testimony yet; you haven't done nothing. Get out and do something for God. Do something.Here some time ago, I was reading of Jack Coy, an Indian guide out there in the West. And he was lost one day. And he couldn't find his way in. And he'd been lost, and his horse was about dead. And she was breathing heavy. All the water was gone. He was in the desert. And he was leading her, staggering. A Christian man, he knew it wouldn't be long until death would finally take them.He was going along. After while, they hit a buffalo trail, where animals had been running. And so, he tried to get on the horse. Then he thought maybe they'd go to water, so he jumped on the horse, and he started going down. The horse couldn't hardly walk, and he couldn't either. So, he got down.]]></verse><verse label="65" type="custom"><![CDATA[65 And after while, the trail separated. And one went this way and one went that way. Well, the one went this way just had a few tracks. But the one that went that way was well blazed. And so, Jack pulled his horse around to start that way, and the old horse wouldn't go that way. He wanted to go back this way. So, Jack tried to spur his horse on. She wouldn't go. She kept nickering, trying to go back this way.And he got real angry, and he threw his spurs into her. He cut her till the blood was running out of her, like that. And she started quivering. She was going to fall. He got off of her, and he thought, She packed me through this desert. She's been good to me and how she... Now, she believes the water is that way. There's not very much of a trail going that way.And that's the way it is tonight, friends. There is not very much of a trail leads this way.

He said, "You have been faithful to carry me this far, and I'm willing to risk my life. I've heard that horses have instincts that they know where water is. Animals..." Said, "If you've carried me this far... I'd have died a long time ago if it hadn't been for you. But I'm going to take your route. I'm about to hold on to you. I'm going to take your route. If we die, we both die together."I think that ... (not comparing my Lord with a horse) But He's packed me this far; this good old Holy Ghost religion has brought me safely this far. At the hour of my death, I'll take a hold of Calvary (Hallelujah!), say, "You carried me through every sick spell, and through the blackness and darkness of life, and through the bitter parts of hell.

She was so poor and bleeding on the side. He didn't get but a little piece farther down the road until they plunged right into a great big gusher of water there.He said he jumped into the water, him and the horse both. And they drank, and he washed her nostrils out. And he patted her and they screamed. And he thanked God, and he raised his hands and cried and shouted, and everything like that. Said he was just having a wonderful time.Directly, he heard somebody laughing. Standing over on the other side was a bunch of drunken prospectors. He come across, and they said, "Who are you?"He said, "I'm Jack Coy, of the Indian reservation."Said, "Well, come on over, Jack." Said, "We got something to eat.

But they'd found gold. And they were on their road back. And they didn't care. They was just having a big time. And they thought they'd have some fun out of him.So, they said... Now, one of them staggered up to him, a little old disfigured looking fellow. He said, "All right, Coy," said, "how about having a drink of our good liquor?"He said, "No thanks, boys, I don't drink."He said, "Ah, come on now." You know how a drunk is. Said, "Yes, you drink. You'll have one drink."Said, "No, boys. Thank you." Said, "I don't drink."Said, "Now, wait. If our venison is good enough to eat, then our whiskey is good enough to drink."

Said, "Now, if our venison is good enough for you to eat, then our whiskey is good enough for you to drink with us. If you're so goody-goody and don't want to drink our whiskey, well then," said, "you can pay. Let your bones bleach on this desert."He said, "Wait just a minute, boys, before you do it."

He said, "I hailed from the old bluegrass country of Kentucky." He said, "Years ago," he said, "I stood in the corner one morning by a little old trundle bed. My daddy was gone.

But I believe that same old time Holy Ghost religion lives in the world today and is willing to save anybody from a life of sin. Amen. Let's see... Oh, my! Let's bow our heads.Our heavenly Father, we thank Thee tonight, that the undergrowth is coming up. The fig tree is putting forth buds again. O God, send the rain, former and latter rain together that the trees might grow, O Lord, coming up in this blistered sin-cursed, damnable world, may it be done to fulfill which was spoken by the prophet Joel. I believe that You'll do it. God, I pray tonight that you'll bless in a marvelous way this people. May the Word of God sink deep in somebody's heart, someone who had an old mother, dad, who knew You. But today, how sad, that mother's religion's laughed at and made fun of. They say it was for old time people. God, It's the same Holy Spirit today. Yeah, they went out and blistered the bark off their churches and trees and took all the life out of it; all the heartfelt religion; all the shouts; all the praises; all the joy; all the healing powers; all that the Bible speaks of, just like a lodge. Go there, return, do the same things of the rest of the world. God bring the undergrowth, quickly Lord; send the rain. Send convictions to hearts tonight, who's needy here; may they find Christ as their Saviour. For we ask it in His Name.And while you have your heads bowed, I wonder tonight, sitting here; if you can remember an old mother, dad, years ago that you said, "Mother, I'll meet you on the other side." You remember when God taken the baby out of the home, you said, "Lord, I'll--I'll serve You." But you failed to do that. Are you here and want to receive Christ as Saviour and wants to be remembered in a word of prayer, would you raise up your hands, right quickly.God bless you, mister. God bless you, sir. God bless you. God bless you and you. Somebody to my right would say, "Brother Branham, remember me in prayer. I--I need Christ as my Saviour. I believe in old-time, heartfelt religion. I believe that the thing..." God bless you, way back there sir, I see. Someone else, would say, "Remember me, Brother Branham," here in the middle aisles? Would you say, "Remember me"? God bless you, sir. God bless you, lady, I see you. Someone else say, "Remember me, Brother Branham, I need Christ as my personal Saviour." Raise up your hands, say, "I want to now accept Christ."I wonder while we have our heads down, we're pressed awful for time. I preached just a little long, but I felt the Holy Spirit would have me do this. Surely you'll respect it as the Word of God. I wonder while the sister gives us a chord on the piano, if those who wants to accept Chirst now as personal Saviour, not time to come down to the altar, but you would stand up and say, "Brother Branham, I now stand as a witness that I forsake sin and accept Christ as my Saviour. Pray for me now." Would you just raise up if you would, just as a sign that you want to accept Him, and then I'll have prayer for you right here, and you stand right where you are, and accept Him. Will you do it? Will you stand up, just say, "I'm standing up now as a sign."Don't let that person setting next to you keep you out of the way. God bless you, lady. God bless you, sir. Just remain standing. Someone else wants to receive Him, raise up. God bless you, sir. God bless you. Just remain standing. Someone else now? God bless you, sister, just remain. God bless you, back there, I see you. Somebody back in here now say... God bless you, sir, just remain standing. Someone else? Say, "I want to accept Christ as my personal Saviour." God sees you. He sees you right there, just the same as He sees you here. God bless you, young lady, I see. That's a gallant deed for you to do. God bless you, sister, I see you. Somebody down in here... down in this way, say, "I want to stand, Brother Branham." Just say, "I now want to accept Christ, in the old fashion way, I want..." God bless both of you ladies.

Now, way back in the back, I see you with your hand up. I know God sees you too. He knows your heart. Would there be one more who wants to accept Christ? I see you sister, with the little baby in your arm, that's fine. Now someone else, would you stand up right quick now? Say, "I want..." God bless you, brother, I see you. God bless you, sister, I see you. That's fine. Just remain standing. God... God bless you, young lady, I see you also.Someone else just stand up, say, "I want to accept Christ right now, Brother Branham. I believe with all my heart that the old fashion religion that John Wesley preached that... Back yonder when Calvin and Knox." Just think of--of George Whitfield, he preached so hard and so loud, they could hear him two miles away, preaching the same Gospel that you're hearing right now. But what's the matter? The big, fine churches don't preach it no more.[Gap in the audio]How many is going to believe out there now, with all your heart? All right, now. Be reverent. This is the hardest thing to do. If you only knew, friends, how that it's swaying from one thing to another. It's like running on one road and taking to another. It's all the Holy Spirit. It's all God, but different ministrations.Now, I'm not a preacher, not... I'm a spare tire. I just kindy, when the preacher ain't there, I try to fill his place. But I--I love the Lord. But my Divine gift from God is to here--pray for the sick people. That's what He commissioned me to do, pray for the sick. But I'm trying to take the preacher's place and also this, also.]]></verse><verse label="74" type="custom"><![CDATA[74 So, swaying from one to another makes it hard. It's two anointings. One anointing is just blessing you. Oh, you feel wonderful. And the other one just cutting the life from you. It's taking from you. One is adding to you, the other one is taking from you. How many understands that? Raise up your hands. Say, "I believe I understand it, Brother Branham." Virtue and stuff that goes from you, the strength of your life pulling out. Visions, what they do.Now, just be as reverent as you can everywhere. And I'm going to do everything I can to pray for every person. I'll try my best to get every person that comes here prayed for before I leave the city. See? And just stick along and be reverent.If you don't get healed before that time, I'll try my best to get you up here and have prayer with you before we--before we leave the city.]]></verse><verse label="75" type="custom"><![CDATA[75 But try to believe God's Word. Just take His Word at it. Now, if I testify of something, and God don't testify of it, then I've told a--something that isn't truth. But if I testify of truth, and God has testifies that that is the truth, then you don't--you mustn't doubt God. You must believe God.Now, Jesus... Is there anybody here for your first time? This a small group tonight. Well, just look at there, for the first time, would you? My. That's where it's bad (You see?), what makes it hard, when you have to find out the petra--the people hardly know the nature of what to do.Now, that's the reason I keep quoting this. See, friends, the Spirit of the Lord--the Spirit of the Lord, when It was upon His Son, Jesus Christ, Jesus did not claim to be a Divine healer. He claimed to be just what He was: the Son of God. But He said, "I can do nothing except My Father shows Me first." Is that Scripture? Saint John 5, when He passed by all them cripples and blind and halt and lame and crippled up people, He didn't heal any of them, went over, healed a man, maybe had prostate trouble or something.How's the nerves getting along, brother, better? Well, I hope this is the time you receive your healing. All right. You come from Virginia, don't you? Somewhere up in the area? All right. That's West Virginia. All right, sir. All right. Now, just have faith. He's here: (uh-huh) the Angel of the Lord.And now, He said, when they questioned Him, when He went by all those people and healed this one man that had diabetes or something, they--they tried to wonder what was the matter. So they questioned this Jesus. And He said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son can do nothing in Himself but what He sees the Father doing. Whatsoever the Father doeth, He showeth the Son, and the Son doeth what He... Father worketh and I worketh hitherto." Is that right? Then He did not do one thing except God told Him to do it and showed Him how to do it. His Words are truth.You believe that's inspired? Sure it is: Saint John 5th chapter. Some of them try to cut Mark 16 out, but what about Saint John 5, then? See? All right. Now, have faith and believe.Now, He said, "The things that I do, shall you also." Is that right? Now, He--He knew the thoughts of the people's heart. When He standing in crowds, He talked to the people. When He was talk--talk--talked to a woman one time at the well, He said, "Come here. Bring Me a drink of water."She said, "It's not customary for Jews to ask Samaritans such, 'cause we have no dealing."He said, "But if you know Who you were talking to, you'd ask Me for a drink; and I'd bring you a drink that you don't come here to draw."Why, she said, "The well's deep."And they went on with a long conversation. After while, when He found out what was her trouble, He went right straight and told her, said, "Go, get your husband." Is that right? Well then, if He's the same yesterday, today, and forever, here this Spirit... If you judge me right, I'll--I'll be either a Spirit of God or a spirit of the devil. You can't be two the same time. There's no black white birds; drunk sober men; sinner saints. You're either right or... You're either a Christian or you're not a Christian. It's either the Spirit of Christ, or not the Spirit of Christ. Bitter and sweet water don't come the same fountains. "By your fruits you shall know them."I've lived in Indiana for nearly forty years. I'm on my third journey around the world. Scientific world and all has tested it, and we got... I guess they had the pictures here tonight. Did you all get one--get to see one, the Angel of the Lord? The brethren have it here.Now, it's not just some picture, some photograph; that's in Washington, DC: the only--only supernatural being in all the world's history that was ever photographed. That's what scientists says. George J. Lacy, on your paper you'll see it there; and you have a photostatic copy of his signature on it.]]></verse><verse label="76" type="custom"><![CDATA[76 Now, here stands... The woman's a stranger to me. I do not know her; I never seen her in my life. God knows her; I don't. If there's anything wrong with the woman, God knows it; but I do not know it. Are we strangers, lady? We are strangers. Now, if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever (I'm talking to the newcomers now; the old ones understand it.) then, if He is the same... He said, "A little while and the world seeth Me no more; yet you'll see Me; for I'll be with you, even in you to the end of the world." Is that right? Then if He's the same, He'll do the same thing here tonight that He would do if He was here in flesh. Is that right? Now, as far as saving you, He couldn't do it if He was standing here tonight. He's already done it. As far as healing you, if He was standing here tonight, He couldn't do it. He's already did it. He's already done everything that can be done. The only thing He could do, is come and represent Himself in a way of preaching, or some kind of a Divine gift to point you to that.But now, if this woman's a stranger to me, and I to her, if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, God could reveal to me, just like He did the woman at the well, where that woman's trouble's at. Is that true? Or He... Like He told Philip when Philip come to Him, He said, "Here comes an Israelite who knows no guile."Said, "When did You know me?" Said, "When..." I mean, Nathanael said."Before Philip called you, when you were under the tree, I saw you." Is that right?Now, may the Lord Jesus bless. I know that He's close, but I want you to believe now with all your heart, and kindly get settled down, and begin to look this a way. Have faith.And you out there without prayer cards or anything, and you sick people that's not up here, you just believe with all your heart. And now look. If I've told you the truth, that Jesus healed you nineteen hundred years ago, every one of you that's got faith enough to believe it, your healing is complete in Christ. Then if that's the truth, God will speak through here and say it's the truth. That's fair, isn't it?Now, I want to talk to you just a moment, lady. You just... Being the first patient, I just want to talk to you a few moments just merely to get the Spirit of the Lord beginning to move. You see? So, I have to have something to believe me. You see? And if He don't come, well then I'm perfectly helpless.But, you've been suffering quite a bit. And the suffering comes from the female organs: it's cancer. Is that right? You believe He'll heal you? Come here just a minute.Now, Father, in the Name of Thy Son Jesus, I ask for this woman's life, knowing that this enemy has caught her, I ask You to move him away from her. As Your humble servant, I pray that You'll grant it. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Don't doubt. Go, believing.Have faith now. Everybody believe with all your heart. All right.Just reverent. All right, lady. Are we strangers? We don't know each other. You just picked up a card a few minutes ago out there. And they called your number, and you come up on the platform. That's as far as life--as we've seen each other or know. Is that true? Then only God knows your heart. I do not. But you're--you're know that something is near. You know that the Spirit of the Lord...You have a strange thing. You're--you're--you're wanting children. Isn't that right? Well, Simeon set in the temple of old--or Eli, rather, said, "The Lord bless, Hagar." And she brought forth a baby. You've been sterile. Come close just a moment.Heavenly Father, in the day that's so evil now, and here's a woman wanting a little one. God bless her, as You have the many hundreds across the country. And make her well of this and may she embrace this loved one that she wishes. In Jesus Christ's Name. Amen. God bless you, sister. Go receive it, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ.]]></verse><verse label="77" type="custom"><![CDATA[77 Now, one day not long ago, a little lady come to my house. She may be here tonight, for all I know. She had been wanting a little baby for years. I had prayer for her, and the lady has the loveliest little boy baby... How many knows Richard ... T. Richard Reed of Jonesboro, Arkansas? Well, the blessed old Bible Hour Tabernacle. He's the pastor there. His wife (many years ago) had been barren for years.And one morning I walked out of the room... She was taking shots from the doctor and everything, which almost caused her to lose her mind. And it didn't do any good. One morning walking out of the room, I said, "Sister Reed, I see you holding a little boy baby in your arms. You shall have it. God has rewarded you."And she was playing an old favorite song of mine. It's not a Christian song. It's "Home On The Range." I think it sounds so peaceful. And I said, "God is going to bring peace to your family, and He's going to bring the little boy baby."And five years from that year, she embraced a little boy baby. And I was holding him two or three weeks ago in my hands, trotting him up-and-down the aisles of the place right where it was said. The Lord God granted. That's one of hundreds.]]></verse><verse label="78" type="custom"><![CDATA[78 You might wonder just why I just saying one thing to the people and let it pass on by. It's because the more you talk to people, more you know about people, as the visions keep breaking. But I want to try to get to as many as I can. You can stand and talk to someone, just keeps on moving, keeps on going, keeps on moving, talking.Now, lady, do you believe the things that you see? You believe it to be the truth? You do. Well, perhaps I'll just talk to you a little bit. Are we strangers? We are strangers. Ma'am? I don't believe I ever seen you in my life. Then if I am a stranger and you are a stranger, neither one of us met each other in life before, and this is our first meeting place, just raise up your hand, so the people will know that that's true.I never seen the lady in all my life, know nothing at all about her. God does. Now, if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever, if I could talk to this woman, and it would be His divine will, He could reveal to me. But it's His will; I can't make it. He could even speak that woman, what's wrong with her, or something about her life, or what she has done, or what's hindering her. Or, if she's something else, God would tell her about it.]]></verse><verse label="79" type="custom"><![CDATA[79 You know how that is. If it is sin in the camp, it'll sure be called out. That's right.

It catches unconfessed sin.But now, I want to talk to the woman. I want you all to be reverent. Now, sister, if our Lord Jesus... I know He loves you, because He died for you. And--and if I be His servant, then--and you His--be His servant, then there'd be something about you, if there is sickness, then there's something here, and both of us human beings... It's trying to get your faith to look to something. That's what I'm talking about. And every word that I'm saying, I--God has to give me utterance, or I wouldn't even be standing here, I'd be dead.
